At Batteries Included, we believe in a simple philosophy: modern technology
shouldn't be a privilege of the few. Building a modern business shouldn't
necessitate a billion-dollar infrastructure team or selling all your
decision-making power and excess profits for access to cloud machine learning.
The tech giants have set a precedent, creating platforms out of reach for many.
But we're here to challenge that.

Our mission is to democratize access to top-tier infrastructure tools,
integrating them seamlessly to provide a platform that rivals the sophistication
of industry leaders. And we do this while ensuring affordability and
user-friendliness, making cutting-edge technology accessible to all.

# Transparency

Transparency isn't just a buzzword for us; it's a way of life. At Batteries
Included, our pay bands are an open book. And here's the best part: if a recruit
is offered a higher salary for a particular bracket, everyone gets a raise. No
hidden agendas, no underhand tactics. We believe in fair play, and our pay
structure is a testament to that.

# Championing Open Source

Our engineers are the lifeblood of Batteries Included. And we don't just confine
them to our projects. We actively encourage them to contribute to open-source
initiatives that drive our platform. From developing new features to patching
existing ones, our team is always on the front lines, ensuring that the
open-source community thrives. Even if projects side step that there's a
constant war between developer popularity and business decisions later.

## The Open Source Dilemma

While our love for open source is unwavering, we recognize its limitations. The
open-core model and fully open source with service companies often struggle to
sustain projects in the long run. The allure of open source is undeniable.
Introduced as a cost-free solution, it sets an expectation of zero expenditure
and zero value. But this anchoring bias can be detrimental, leaving open source
projects starved for funds because they became well known.

# Supporting the Open Source Community

We've taken a proactive approach rather than merely pointing out the flaws.
Batteries Included is proud to sponsor open-source developers on GitHub. Through
recurring sponsorships and on-the-spot contributions, we're giving back to the
community that's the backbone of the tech world.

# Open Source: A Necessity, Not a Luxury

Open source is more than just software; it's a movement. It ensures that even
those without the means can experience the wonders of technology. Budding
enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even someone with a makeshift computer in their
garage must be free to explore and innovate. This freedom to compute is
non-negotiable.

At Batteries Included, we're committed to upholding this ethos. While our
premium offerings cater to business-scale needs, we haven't forgotten the little
guy. Our free version ensures that everyone has access regardless of their
resources. Because at the end of the day, it's not about how much you have but
what you do with what you've got.
