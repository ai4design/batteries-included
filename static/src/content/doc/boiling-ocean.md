# Open Source

A platform play can seem daunting and like we have to create all the software
that Google or Amazon have ever written. Additionally it would seem too daunting
and impossible to develop such a large system in a reasonable time with a
reasonable team. However the good thing is that most needed large systems have
been built already in open source. We can greatly increase our velocity by
taking the already proven open source technologies, like many FAANG do, and
build on top of those.

# Sell along the way

The platform provides compounding power when built; it also provides this with a
partial set of headline services. That allows us to build a small part of the
platform and then iterate as we get customer feedback, much the same that AWS
started out. We have to start with enough insights in the platform for the sum
of the part to be greater than the whole. The rest will follow in an iterative
manner.
