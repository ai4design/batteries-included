# Cloud

Imagine you are a leader at a company that has a problem with software infrastructure. You want someone to make everything easier for you. So you search around for a solution and find the cloud. Open up a leading cloud provider, and you will find close to 200 different services; many are only slightly different from others, all are complex with hundreds of settings, none are easy to operate. Now you have to learn in-depth technical information about vendor-specific technology before being able to pay the cloud provider for the service that's closest to what you need.

The cloud didn't sell you the solution. In essence, this amounts to telling you:

> You have a problem; the cloud can solve it for you as long as you spend years learning the problem space first and dedicate operational resources to keep it running in an ongoing manner.

Companies have to be their own sales associate, and they get a good but not ideal solution.

# No Cloud

Now imagine that same company doesn't want to or can't use the public cloud. Instead of a list of services, there are thousands of open source projects, hundreds of different SaaS companies, and more consulting providers to choose from. Your choice is even harder, but also no solution gives you more than one service. You are responsible for matching the problem to the solution (picking software or SaaS), describing the solution wanted (writing the consulting contract), coordinating how all of the different services/solutions are interoperable (configuring everything), and ongoing operation.
