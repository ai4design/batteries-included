While a platform with the best features completely integrated is a broadly helpful thing, we also need a laser focus on our first customers. So who are going to be the target customers for V1.0 of the platform?

V1.0's target customers are Series-A or B early stage technology companies who are just starting to think about hiring their first DevOps & SRE team. We will be most helpful to early companies currently building websites, microservices, or internal services and need to stabilize or scale their early version. These companies want to quickly iterate while producing a stable, easy to debug, and simple to run product.
