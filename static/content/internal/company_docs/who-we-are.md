We empower businesses to incubate, grow, scale, transform, observe, and manage
what matters most to them rather than worrying about the minutia of DevOps,
GitOps, or MLOps. Batteries Included is a company with a vision of an
easier-to-use, friendlier, and more powerful software infrastructure platform in
a box. We are building the all-inclusive platform for technology companies on
top of Kubernetes, operating the best in open source with battle-tested tooling
and insights built-in. There's no YAML or new configuration language to learn;
instead, powerful automation allows you to use cutting-edge machine learning,
databases, networking, and security tools through a simple unified interface.
