Phoenix is an amazing framework that we use and love at Batteries Included. We also really love tailwind CSS. So using both with the latest up to date software is important to us. Below is a quick write up on how we've modified the default phoenix install to use webpack 5 and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

# Starting Point

```bash
mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.9
mix phx.new --live example_upgrade
cd example_upgrade
```

# Upgrade Versions

Next we need to get the js dependencies to be compatible with webpack5 and TailwindCSS. Some software will need new updated versions, while others won't be compatible with newer webpack, and still others won't be useful with Tailwind.

We're going to use tailwind which uses css and postcss for styling. Since sass has gone through several version upgrades and we're not going to rely on it actively, I'm going to remove it rather than ensure that I don't break things. Lets first remove the things that we're not going to use any more.

```bash
cd assests
npm remove sass-loader node-sass \
    hard-source-webpack-plugin \
    optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin
```

Next I want to upgrade all the webpack things. Webpack 5 was a breaking change that will require some elixir code changes. First let's upgrade. Here I'm going to use a utility and upgrade all the dependencies to know latest versions. You can upgrade however you want.

```bash
npm i -g npm-check-updates
ncu -u webpack webpack-cli terser-webpack-plugin \
    css-loader copy-webpack-plugin \
    babel-loader mini-css-extract-plugin \
    "@babel/preset-env" "@babel/core"
npm i
```

# Add on Tailwind and PostCSS

Before making changes to `webpack.config.js` lets install the tailwind dependencies and build tools. These are all generating code that will be in the final css, so they can be dev dependencies.

```bash
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography \
    autoprefixer postcss postcss-loader \
    postcss-import css-minimizer-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

# Change Webpack Config

`webpack.config.js` needs to be changed since we're drastically chaning build versions and tools. First terser became part of the build and other css/js optimization plugins haven't been needed or updated for this version so lets make the needed changes.

For example the setting `devtool` needs to be updated in webpack 5. That line becomes:

```js:webpack.config.js
devtool: devMode ? 'source-map' : undefined,
```

Terser became part of the main webpack build. Since there's no longer a need to configure that and sourcemaps we can greatly simplify the optimization setting.

```js:webpack.config.js
    optimization: {
      minimizer: ['...', new CssMinimizerPlugin()],
    },
```

We want to use post css and tailwind we'll need to change the module settings to include postcss and the file types we expect.

For me the css loader was configured like this previously:

```js:webpack.config.js
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.js$/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader'
          }
        },
        {
          test: /\.[s]?css$/,
          use: [
            MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
            'css-loader',
            'sass-loader',
          ],
        }
      ]
    },
```

We're not going to use sass and we do want svg and post sass. The end result for me is that the modules rules become:

```js:webpack.config.js
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.js$/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
          },
        },
        {
          test: /\.[s]?css$/,
          use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'],
        },
        {
          test: /\.svg$/i,
          type: 'asset/inline',
        },
        {
          test: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
          type: 'asset/resource',
        },
        {
          test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
          type: 'asset/resource',
        },
      ],
    },
```

The key changes were:

- Change to css file type
- Remove sass loader
- Add PostCSS loader
- Add on image and font file types

The plugins section and mode section need small tweaks becoming:

```js:webpack.config.js
    plugins: [
      new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: '../css/app.css' }),
      new CopyWebpackPlugin({
        patterns: [{ from: 'static/', to: '../' }],
      }),
    ],

```

# Finalize Changes

`app.scss` needs to be `app.css` and we need to include tailwind. We'll also need to clean up sass leftovers and renames.

```bash
# Move the file
mv css/app.scss css/app.css

# Remove the sass imports
sed -i '/@import/d' css/app.css

# Add the Tailwind imports
echo "$(echo "@import 'tailwindcss/base'" ; cat css/app.css)" > css/app.css
echo "$(echo "@import 'tailwindcss/components'" ; cat css/app.css)" > css/app.css
echo "$(echo "@import 'tailwindcss/utilities'" ; cat css/app.css)" > css/app.css

# Reflect the new name in the js
sed -i 's/scss/css/g' js/app.js
```

Also add the `NODE_VERSION` environment variable when building the producttion version of our style and javascript assets. To do all of this we'll need to change the scripts field in the `package.json` file. That will end up looking like this:

```js:package.json
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "NODE_ENV=production webpack --mode production",
    "watch": "webpack --mode development --watch"
  },
```

# PostCSS and Tailwind

Tailwind and postcss both need some configs. Lets create those. For postcss I am going to add `assets/postcss.config.js` that looks like this:

```js:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

Then for tailwindCSS i'm going to add a file `assets/tailwind.config.js` that should look like:

```js:tailwind.config.js
const typography = require("@tailwindcss/typography");

module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: [
    "./js/**/*.js",
    "./js/**/*.ts",
    "../lib/**/*.ex",
    "../lib/**/*.leex",
    "../lib/**/*.eex",
    "../lib/**/*.sface",
  ],
  darkMode: false,
  plugins: [typography],
};
```

For the most part that just sets the defaults. You can add your own colors or add other tailwind plugins as you see fit. This config does use the tailwind jit which we've found to be faster but a little prone to missing a new class being added.

# Building

That should be good enough to get everything build check that by running the production build.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If that works then we're all good to go for the next steps.

# Dev Server STDIN

Webpack changed the command line arguments for it's watch and compile mode. That feature is used during development, and we're going to need to make changes to the Phoenix endpoint in dev.

Currently there should be a config in `config/dev.exs` inside there is a key for configuring the static watchers.

## Before:

```elixir:config/dev.exs
config :example_upgrade, ExampleUpgradeWeb.Endpoint,
  http: [port: 4000],
  debug_errors: true,
  code_reloader: true,
  check_origin: false,
  watchers: [
    node: [
      "node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js",
      "--mode",
      "development",
      "--watch-stdin",
      cd: Path.expand("../assets", __DIR__)
    ]
  ]
```

## After:

```elixir:config/dev.exs
config :example_upgrade, ExampleUpgradeWeb.Endpoint,
  http: [port: 4000],
  debug_errors: true,
  code_reloader: true,
  check_origin: false,
  watchers: [
    node: [
      "node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js",
      "--mode=development",
      "--watch",
      "--watch-options-stdin",
      cd: Path.expand("../assets", __DIR__)
    ]
  ]
```

Notice how `mode` is now equal to development and we're watching and watching otions-stdin the changes are subtle but important.

# Done

With everything all done you should be good to go. Webpack 5 should be running and integrated with phoenix. TailwindCSS should be usable and purged if un-used. We've put the result of the upgrade up in a repository here: [example_phoenix](https://github.com/batteries-included/example_phoenix) Each commit should be one step of the process above.
