There's a need for an integrated software platform with all the parts of a modern tech stack pre-configured to work together, tuned, and operated hands off. Savvy and well constructed infrastructure can be a force multiplier for the business, but it requires lots of moving pieces that integrate together, smoothly, stably, and scalably to create something that's more than the parts. That's not easy or cheap.

Companies want to pay to have their undifferentiated infrastructure problems completely solved, and an all inclusive upscale solution would command a good price while being unique in the market. We can provide that integrated collaborative platform, automated operations to scale, and experienced teams for specialty work; that will make Batteries Included total offering better than much of the cloud and an infrastructure team.

# Any Company's Infrastructure Team

Anecdotally all tech companies end up with an infrastructure team in name or in self appointed function. Modern businesses just always seem to need lots of the same software including databases, networking, email, server health, file storage, web servers, etc. This lower level stack continues to grow more and more complex wieht each level building on the hard won knowledge of engineers, who love the details of bytes, iops, hertz, and pps. However these contributions are often unrealized and forgotten because these backend systems are not unique, driving business, and they didn't get completed.

Most companies needs a database but few are making extra money because they have a better database. The same can be said for lots of critical software.

Since businesses keep creating the infrastructure team it has to be instructive of what they really want. These teams are all building a platform to tie all the systems together, then giving that platform to the product focused or business focused parts of the company.

How many start up companies around the world are burning VC capital building a login page for the ML notebooks? or a listing page for the database backups? Lots and lots of duplicated work that has to be maintained, or worse breaks production. These small teams don't have the resources to dedicate and love every part of the platform.

# Tech Leaders

World class tech companies are investing heavily into their internal tools platforms. It's their super power that's used to move into new markets quickly and turn around struggling acqisitions. Starting the next photo sharing app at a FAANG is easier because the hard parts are simply an arms reach away. Need scalable storage? Yep it's over there. Need fast easy ML? Yep easy to build models right this way? Build service, hosting, monitoring.... Yep all done already.

## Not Hotdog

This super power directly impacts the startup world all the time. Take the hypothetical famous app [Not Hotdog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) the following sequence is so beleivable it seems trite:

- Not Hotdog launches and sees some mild success
- The app continues to trend upwards until it gest an unexpected boost.
- The unexpexted traffic starts [straining fragile infrastructure](https://twitter.com/failwhale/photo)
- The startup has to dedicate focus and resources to their internal infrastructure. While small competitor spends this time the major companies have started their own competitor.
- Either the scaling issues get bad enough, or the FAANG app gains momentum, or building the plaform burns enough capital and this ends up with an early sale.
- The buyer then throws their ready made and highly funded technology platform at the issue and rights the ship.

# Cloud

Cloud shows that there's a ravenous market for solutions that make technology easier, cheaper, and more elastic. Many companies are willing to pay [large ( $332B )](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021) amounts to make computing even a small amount easier. ( [This](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2021/04/24/Figure-1.-Current-architecture-with-improved-resiliency-and-standardized-observability.jpg) is easier? )

However the cloud's not easy. Far from it. Many teams now dedicate large portions of their time to cloud ops. Instead of making the computing burdeon easy the cloud has force subdivided the work and charged more for the privilege of using their software after renting their hardware. The cloud remains hard but easier than any alternative.

# Solution

Batteries Included is building a modern technial infrastructure stack, and the infrastructure team to back it up. Every part of the platform will be cared for making it automatically operate and configure itself on any customers set up. Each and every subsystem should be intgrated and work well with each other. No need for hard decisions because our world class experts have already made those then automated and integrated everything. We have built all the integrations together with the best user interfaces and the best backend systems. All of this can be offered in an easy to use system that hides the complexity of AWS, GKE, or your own hardware.

No need to learn a new programming language to create a [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database for a new project. Instead go to the dashboard click a button and answer common sense prose questions. Boom database all set with world class monitoring, backups, etc. Everything is there because our team has delivered better than any other infrastructure team all combined in one scalable package.

We don't provide just the currently expected tools though. Batteries Included provides the tools that are needed tomorrow. So we have a full suite of everything needed to get impact from machine learning. From being able to spawn collaborative software to train production models while deploying and monitoring production models. The Batteries Included platform will guide and make easier the getting the most out of technologies like pytorch, kubeflow, spark, and argo.

This allows your engineers to focus on building the parts of the company that are uniue and allows your datascientists to focus on finding new insights for models. All of this is possible because the plaform has made it easy to use and share all the infrastructure from datastorage to networking to logging to monintoring everything is integrated and operated by the best.
