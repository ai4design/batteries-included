# Main Platform Goals

We have to provide value to customers that show we are more than just a single piece of software being installed once. We need to provide value in an on ongoing way. Something that's tangible and core our customers' the business interests are best; though providing that value to developers in a way that makes them more efficient can be good too. Continued stability and ease of operations would be a tertiary benefit that we can provide.

## Business Value

If our tools make it possible to do something that customers couldn't before, then it's easy to show the value we drive.

- Enable something to scale past a hard limit. For example we could build a storage platform that will allow us to automatically shard and distribute data, enabling datasets of larger than one machine.
  -Enabling customers who can't be in the public cloud to use the S3, scalable load balancers, or other important features of public clouds for the first time.
- Make something faster. Our response times are X% faster on average because of automated tuning, automated configuration, or operational knowledge built into our system.

## Developer Efficiency

Hiring teams of developers and operations people to run infrastructure is expensive. Lets make it possible to run a software business at any scale without huge infrastructure teams. Developers are expensive so making it possible to build things with much smaller teams is a pretty huge thing.

## Stability and Operational Excellence

It takes years of really operating ML and distributed systems before you really have an intuition about the right and wrong way to build infra. So rather than training people for years or competing the FAANG's of the world for talent. Lets build that expertise and knowledge into software. Make doing the right thing default and easy.
